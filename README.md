## Currency Converter App - A Kotlin Multiplatform Application

**Features:**

- Convert between various currencies
- View the latest exchange rates
- Available on both Android and iOS

**Technologies:**

- **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM):** Enables code sharing between Android and iOS platforms.
- **Compose Multiplatform:** Provides a declarative UI framework for building user interfaces across platforms.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
  - Android Studio with the Kotlin plugin installed
  - Xcode with Swift support

2. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter-app.git)
    ```

3. **Open the project in Android Studio**

## Project Structure:

* **`/composeApp`** (Shared Code):
    * **`commonMain`**: Code shared across all platforms (Android, iOS). This could include business logic, data models, and network layer logic.
    * **`androidMain`**: Platform-specific code for Android. This might involve integrating with Android APIs or UI elements specific to Android.
    * **`iosMain`**: Platform-specific code for iOS. This could include integrating with SwiftUI or iOS-specific APIs.
* **`/iosApp`** (iOS Entry Point):
    * This folder contains the entry point for the iOS application. While UI is shared with Compose Multiplatform, this folder is necessary for launching the app on iOS. You might also include SwiftUI code for specific iOS UI elements here.
